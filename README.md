# Skill Swap
 SkillSwap is a web application that allows users to exchange their skills with others. Users can create profiles, list the skills they possess and their learning interests, search for potential matches, and send swap requests to other users. The platform also includes social features like interest groups and forums, as well as a rating and review system.
# Main Features:

## User Authentication & Profiles: 
Users can sign up, log in, and create profiles where they list their skills, the skills they want to learn, and a short bio. They can also upload a profile picture and manage their account settings.

## Skill Management: 
Users can add, edit, or remove skills from their profiles, specifying their proficiency level and availability for teaching or learning.

## Browse & Search: 
Users can browse through profiles or search for specific skills, locations, or user names. They can also apply filters such as skill category, proficiency level, and distance.

## Matching & Recommendations: 
The application suggests potential matches for users based on their skills and learning interests. Users can also manually search for matches and send swap requests to other users.

## Swap Requests & Messaging: 
Users can send, receive, and manage swap requests. Once a request is accepted, a private messaging channel is created for the users to discuss and arrange their skill swap sessions.

## Ratings & Reviews: 
After completing a skill swap session, users can rate and review their experience with the other user. This helps maintain the quality of the community and provides valuable feedback for future skill swaps.

## Social Features: 
Users can follow other users, join interest groups, and participate in forum discussions related to skill sharing and learning.
